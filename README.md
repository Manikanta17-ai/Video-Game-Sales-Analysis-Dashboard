# Video-Game-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
I have analyzed global video game sales data from 1980 to 2020 using SQL for data extraction and transformation, Pandas for preprocessing, and Power BI for interactive visualizations. This project provides insights into sales trends, top-selling games, and regional performance across different platforms and publishers.
