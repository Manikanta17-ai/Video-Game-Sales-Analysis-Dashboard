## Conclusion
Working on this project gave me a deeper understanding of the video game industry's sales patterns over the years. Using SQL, Python (Pandas), and Power BI, I was able to clean and analyze the data, uncovering key insights about top-selling games, popular platforms, and regional sales trends.

One of the most interesting takeaways was how certain platforms and genres dominated different eras, showing how gaming trends evolved. Seeing Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox battle it out over the years was fascinating.

This project was a great learning experience, and Iâ€™m excited to take it further.
